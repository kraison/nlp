College becomes increasingly unaffordable, should there be a shift from college focussed guidance and education, and more on work skills and certification that could pay living wages now and college could be approached later? Destigmatizing skills centers and trade education should be important to help all students, not just those at risk.

Contaminants and fertilizers clinging to soil slide right into streams, rivers, and Puget Sound, where they enrich the receiving waters and enable aquatic plant life to thrive and then die, using critical dissolved oxygen (DO) during respiration and decomposition stages. Shifts in aquatic vegetation and plankton species favor some and deprive others, which often portends changes in organisms higher up the food chain and economic ladder.

Dear Support,I was traveling for two weeks and two days before coming back Ring stopped recording and responding. When I came back, I found that it has lost connection with the wi-fi and had to setup it again like I did when I installed it. Wi-fi was working when I came back, so it looks like Ring just lost the connection and wasn't able to reconnect back before I returned home. It concerns me, because I bought the device to rely on it being available while I'm absent from home. Ivan

Great product.  I get the video RMR service feature is very good for your company but many people will not like the idea that you are recording everything that happens in front of their house. There should be a physical switch to kill that.With your video  feed cut off, people should be able to record their own video via WiFi and also have video on demand. You'll sell a lot more devices.

I'm a 30 year state employee - just learned that the Employee Suggestion Program is no more and the Productivity Board was suspended in the 11-13 budget. & This program allowed state employees to be a part of solutions and if they met the right criteria to be eligible for a cash award. & The state is losing the brain power of a huge number of persons on the front lines who could best come up with cost saving suggestions creating a more efficient government - which is one of your focus areas as I recall? The program gave just the right amount of incentive and recognition with well thought out controlling guidelines as established by the WAC (Chapter 383-06). & Too many agencies/boards/committees was ridiculous and they needed cropping but losing this program was a mistake.

I'm writing from a small community museum that hopes to use our Ring Video Doorbell by our entrance. As we will be getting a rather high volume of traffic, I was hoping you could address a few concerns:1) Slow response time (there is a ~30 sec delay between ring and an alert on the phone)2) Trouble after the first ring (the circle spins white, then flashes white before returning to stasis)I hope there is something we can do to fix this. Thanks, and look forward to hearing from you!

Just curious, what will happen if a non-removable battery phone hangs? in removable battery phone we have an option to remove battery and then put it back in order to a force restart.
Just installed the ring about a month ago.  Already needed to recharge the battery.  After recharging the battery the app still shows battery at 0% and there is no motion detection and the app is never notified when the button is pressed.  Even though the device rings outside.
just recharged my unit.  it wont update to 100% in the device settings, nor does it work when i remount it
Just wanted to know how well it stands up to different weather conditions

Manipulation within ecosystems can foretell failure in altered systems because natural checks and balances are disturbed. While Chinese research findings that show toxic levels of PSP (and/or arsenic) in Geoduck flesh might be wrong, that is just the kind of thing that can happen when systems become severely disturbed. While red tide and PSP sometimes occurred during summers thirty years ago, now shellfish beds might be closed several times a year due to PSP, toxic algae, or bacterial contamination.

My iphone connects to my home wi-fi by default. when i go to wi-fi settings and choose the ring, it moves Ring into the connected wi-fi group and moves my home wi-fi down to the 'choose a network list', so the iphone is connected to Ring but not my wi-fi.  Is this the correct way to setup Ring to my wi-fi?  And how does Ring stay connected to my home wi-fi when I take my iphone with me to work, etc.

Regarding decisions on aquaculture, many people who have the ability to buy or rent state shorelines are likely to plant as many individuals of the same species, currently Geoduck clams, as the state allows. These will supplant other bivalves like previously-planted Manila clams and Japanese oysters, which earlier helped supplant less prolific littleneck, razor, and butter clams, and delicate Olympia oysters.
Regarding showpieces. I have a showpiece I`d like to share but it contains music that I`m only allowed to use for non-commercial purposes. As the showpiece itself is more to show available footage and the music is non-relevant to the buyer, I assume this would be ok?
Regarding the field where I can add a tax code can I do this at any point as long as the item is still in my inventory and not sold?  Can I do it from IL and I assume it feeds to Amazon? 
Regarding transportation and how to pay (at least partially) for improvements, why doesn't the the state exempt the state portion of the sales tax on these projects?  The 6.5% of the project cost is the state paying itself for the sales/use tax.  Why not use that money to build a road instead of suspend it by having the state pay it to a contractor who then in turn returns it to the state?  This principle is generally true about any taxable state purchases as a taxable consumer.

Restrict all new sewer hook-ups in all incorporated cities or towns and unincorporated areas that have "combined sewer overflow" incidents during storm events until "concurrency" is attained, as the GMA envisioned. Concurrency will be met when pipes carrying sewage to treatment plants is separated from pipes carrying rain or storm water to a storm water treatment plant or receiving water body. Many combined sewer overflows still exist and they prevent the restoration of aquatic ecological functions.

Several months ago our device stopped working with our iphone apps.  We thought it was because the battery died on the doorbell, but now the doorbell is working, but doesnt ring through to the iphones / ipads.  I've checked the settings in my app and both "Call Alerts" and "Motion Alerts" are switched on. This functionality was the reason we purchased the doorbell  so obviously we are very keen to have this issue resolved.  Thanks
Several times over the last few days the door bell has not rung when someone came to door.  Later I tried it by walking out the front door and it sent a notification.  Later in the day someone came to the door but no notification.

Sure fire way to increase public recreation land use--add flushing toilets to some sites. Also, maybe start a "cleaner than you found it," program which applies a credit/discount for the following year's discover pass if you properly report and clean a site which was left full of garbage by a previous camper. Maybe make it a small program so you can scan for and prevent abuses of the system. The Browns Creek area had multiple camp sites which were left messy and reeking of human waste when we camped there a year ago. It would have been an ideal place to return to if it hadn't been so disgusting.

The five detailed goals and their flow chart strategies sound good and could heal all Washington’s problems. However, there are many blind alleys in each goal and chart. Most people probably agree with most of the educational topics on the list, but there might be no viable way to get there from here. State’s taxes and levees are too low and unpredictable to fully fund and sustain good school systems that can educate students on an assured continuum from kindergarten through high school graduation.

The network setup process did not work for me.  When I reach the step to press the orange button on the back of the Ring device, I do not see a Ring network on the iPhone's Wi-Fi page.  I presume a single press is what's intended since the instruction did not say "Press and hold."  I have a laptop in use at the same location and its Wi-Fi does not see the Ring network either.  I cannot proceed until this step is resolved.

Or do I just need Wifi connection in my house for it to work?

The Ring device has stopped communicating with my Iphone.  The device does ring and the blue light 'rotates' but nothing comes through to my phone.  I had to turn off my wireless router the other day to relocate it, does this have any bearing on the problem? (Every other wireless device in the house is operating fine after the relocation of the router, but not Ring)How do I troubleshoot the issue and get it going again?ThanksScott
The ring doesn't always pick up people as they walk up to the door like deliveries, the packages just appear. If the door bell is rung the person usualy gets about 20' away before I can answer.

The secure fiber network referenced in the Seattle Times Editorial page 11/25/2014 is listed as an opportunity for state uses. Does the state own this network , contract with a provider(s) ?

The sound is very poor when I speak to someone at the door. I can't hear them and they can't hear me well. The sound cuts out a lot.  The wiFi connection seems fine and everything else works great.
The sound will go off on my phone that there is motion, but when I try to open the app to see what's going on, I often get an IO Error and cannot open the instance.
The speaker on the external device cannot hear person inside talking.  No two way .  Please advise
the speed of the phone depends on what?
The subsection numbering for 4.1 is more confusing than it needs to be. Would suggest eliminating the (xx) number format for items 2, 4, and 6, because they are simply the necessary clarifications for the items 1, 3, and 5... As formatted, it suggests there are six classification categories, and you really only have three: public, sensitive, and confidential (which has a/b/c specific additional notes).
The  supplied fixing screws are rusting. Making it hard to remove and charge..  Is it possible to get some replacement screws?

This is all well and good and, of course, we want our children and society to be better educated but where is the incentive to hire, obtain and keep talented teachers when you constantly SHOW them that they are unappreciated in both salary and COLA. You raise your own perdium without a blink of the eye and then eat cake and point to teachers with the crumbs still falling out of your mouths. It is hypocritical and a bit embarrassing.

This is in regard to LEED-NC 2.2 (2006) EQ Credit 3.2: IAQ Testing (Option 2).  Submittals have been disputed given that particulate matter (PM) has a “maximum concentration” of 50 µg/m3 and results were compared to the average PM collected over the four hour period.  Specifically, PM was collected every minute for 240 minutes and then averaged for comparison to the maximum 50 µg/m3.  It has been noted that that our submittal has been rejected given that each of the 240 data points was not compared to the 50 µg/m3 of the submittal.  This is in contradiction to OSHA/EPA guidelines/regulations where PM is determined on a time weighted average (TWA).  Please clarify.

Washington’s ecosystems are fragile and the carrying capacity is already exceeded in most of the state.

While listening to the audio segments, the server keeps pausing and often halts and resets.  When I tried to listen on my cell phone, it does not remember the last place, starts at the beginning and does not let me pause, restart or start somewhere else.
While out of the country I was receiving notifications and videos just fine even on 3G, until about a week into the trip. Came home and both doorbells are charged fine, the internet connection is fine and my wireless is working fine with my other devices. My iPhone notifications were never changed in any way yet I stopped receiving notifications on motion and doorbell activation. Do I need to just reset everything and start from scratch?
